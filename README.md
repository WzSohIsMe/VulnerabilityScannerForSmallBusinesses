# Vulnerability Scanner For Small Businesses

Vulnerabiliy Scanner is my Final Year Project. This tool is tailored to small businesses' needs, solving the problem of limited cybersecurity budgets, complexity of cybersecurity solutions, and the lack of time to manage cyberseccurity. It provides user-friendly design, easy port scanning, and simplified vulnerability reporting.
